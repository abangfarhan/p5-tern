The resulting value will\nalways be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be animated by moving\nthrough the noise space as demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd\nand 3rd dimension can also be interpreted as time.<br /><br />The actual\nnoise is structured similar to an audio signal, in respect to the\nfunction&#39;s use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in\nphysics, perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added\ntogether for the final result. <br /><br />Another way to adjust the\ncharacter of the resulting sequence is the scale of the input\ncoordinates. As the function works within an infinite space the value of\nthe coordinates doesn&#39;t matter as such, only the distance between\nsuccessive coordinates does (eg. when using <b>noise()</b> within a\nloop). As a general rule the smaller the difference between coordinates,\nthe smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.
